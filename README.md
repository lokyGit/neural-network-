# neural-network-
This project is to train a feedforward neural network model to execute a binary coded decimal (BCD) adder problem. Ideally,I created a script to transform the 8-bit input into a 5-bit output which includes the carry forward bit. I worked on the design of the neural network model by experimenting with different combinations of hidden layers and neurons. I started simple and then increased the complexity as necessary.
